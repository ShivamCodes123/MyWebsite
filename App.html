        <p>
            Welcome to the information webpage for the Running Workout Generator. I used my running knowledge from cross country to try and create a mobile app that generates the perfect user specific running workouts. It is a unique app as there is not much
            info on creating good distance running workouts online and certainly no apps doing it for you. My goal for the app is for it to be useful for newer distance runners. It is soon to be available on the App Store!
