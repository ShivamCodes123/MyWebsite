            I am a senior at Leander High School. I love distance running, football, and just being outside in general. I'm passionate about computer science and hope to continue using my skills in HTML,
            CSS, Java, and Python to help make this world a better place. I value myself in my leadership skills, proactive mindset, and strong moral compass. This website has all the projects I've done,
            including games, research papers, and iphone applications I have made over the years. Hope you find something interesting here!
            </p>
